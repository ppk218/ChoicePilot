# Enhanced Context-Aware Dynamic Follow-Up System Test Report

## Summary
The enhanced context-aware dynamic follow-up system was tested with 5 specific test scenarios designed to evaluate its ability to adapt questions based on what the user said in their previous answers. The system is partially working as expected, with a 40% success rate (2 out of 5 tests passed).

## Test Results

### ✅ Test 1: Vague Answer → Sharper Follow-up (PASSED)
- Initial: "Should I switch careers?"
- Answer 1: "I don't know, just feeling unsure" (VAGUE/SHORT)
- Expected: Next question should be sharper, more specific to get concrete details
- Result: The system correctly generated a sharper follow-up question: "What specific factors are making you feel unsure about your career?"
- Observation: The follow-up question includes the word "specific" and directly references the user's feeling of being "unsure" from their previous answer.

### ❌ Test 2: Detailed Answer → Deeper Follow-up (FAILED)
- Initial: "Should I quit my marketing job to become a freelance graphic designer?"
- Answer 1: "I've been working in marketing for 5 years but always loved design. I have some freelance clients already and 6 months savings. My main concern is health insurance and steady income." (DETAILED)
- Expected: Next question should go deeper into their specific concerns (health insurance, income planning)
- Result: The system generated a generic follow-up question: "What emotions are driving this decision?"
- Observation: The follow-up question did not reference any specific details from the user's answer, such as "health insurance", "steady income", "freelance clients", or "6 months savings". It failed to go deeper into the specific concerns mentioned.

### ✅ Test 3: Conflicted Answer → Clarifying Follow-up (PASSED)
- Initial: "Should I move to a new city for a job?"
- Answer 1: "Part of me wants the adventure and career growth, but I'm scared to leave my family and friends. The salary is 30% higher but cost of living is also much higher." (CONFLICTED)
- Expected: Next question should help clarify priorities between career growth vs. relationships
- Result: The system generated a clarifying follow-up question: "What specific aspects of family and friends weigh on your decision?"
- Observation: The follow-up question directly addresses one of the conflicting aspects mentioned in the user's answer (family and friends) and asks for clarification on what specifically matters about this aspect.

### ❌ Test 4: Question References Previous Answer (FAILED)
- Initial: "Should I buy a house or continue renting?"
- Answer 1: "I've been renting for 8 years and have $60,000 saved for a down payment. Houses in my area cost between $350,000-$400,000, which would be about 30% higher monthly cost than my current rent."
- Expected: Next question should reference specific details from the previous answer
- Result: The system generated a generic follow-up question: "What factors matter most to you in this decision?"
- Observation: The follow-up question did not reference any specific details from the user's answer, such as the down payment amount, house prices, or monthly cost comparison.

### ❌ Test 5: Gap-Filling Questions (FAILED)
- Initial: "Should I go back to school for a master's degree?"
- Answer 1: "I'm 32 years old and working in IT. I'm interested in data science and AI. I'm worried about the cost and time commitment."
- Expected: Next question should ask about information not already provided
- Result: The system generated a follow-up question: "What specific costs are you most concerned about?"
- Observation: While the question does ask about costs, which was mentioned as a concern, it doesn't fill information gaps by asking about areas not mentioned at all, such as current education level, employer support, family situation, or career goals.

## Code Analysis

The implementation in `generate_smart_followup_questions()` in `ai_orchestrator_v2.py` includes code for context-aware question generation:

```python
# Create enhanced context including previous answers
if previous_answers and len(previous_answers) > 0:
    context = f"""Initial Question: {initial_question}

Previous Answers:
{chr(10).join([f"Answer {i+1}: {answer}" for i, answer in enumerate(previous_answers)])}

Based on the user's previous responses, generate the next most valuable follow-up question.
Focus on areas that need clarification or deeper exploration based on what they've already shared.
Adapt the question style based on their answer tone:
- If vague: ask sharper, more specific questions
- If conflicted: ask clarifying questions about priorities
- If detailed: go deeper into specific concerns they mentioned
"""
else:
    context = initial_question
```

The prompt includes instructions to:
1. Focus on areas that need clarification or deeper exploration
2. Adapt the question style based on answer tone
3. Go deeper into specific concerns for detailed answers

However, the actual questions generated don't consistently demonstrate this awareness. The system appears to be correctly identifying vague and conflicted answers, but fails to:
1. Consistently go deeper into specific concerns mentioned in detailed answers
2. Reference specific details from previous answers
3. Fill information gaps based on what the user already shared

## Recommendations

1. Enhance the prompt to more explicitly instruct the LLM to:
   - Always reference at least one specific detail from the user's previous answer
   - For detailed answers, explicitly instruct to follow up on specific concerns mentioned
   - For information gaps, provide a list of common decision factors and instruct to ask about ones not mentioned

2. Consider implementing a two-step process:
   - First, analyze the user's answer to identify key details, concerns, and information gaps
   - Then, generate a follow-up question based on this analysis

3. Add validation to ensure generated questions meet the criteria:
   - Check if the question references specific details from the previous answer
   - For detailed answers, verify that the question addresses specific concerns mentioned
   - For information gaps, confirm that the question asks about information not already provided

4. Improve the testing framework to provide more detailed feedback on why questions fail to meet the criteria, which could help with debugging and improving the system.
