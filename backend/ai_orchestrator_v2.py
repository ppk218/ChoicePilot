2. **Priority Alignment**: How well do options align with stated priorities?
3. **Risk Assessment**: Identify and evaluate potential risks
4. **Creative Alternatives**: Innovative approaches and out-of-the-box solutions
5. **Persona Perspectives**: Consider views from different advisor types:
   - Realist: "{self.personas['realist']['prompt_modifier']}"
   - Visionary: "{self.personas['visionary']['prompt_modifier']}"
   - Pragmatist: "{self.personas['pragmatist']['prompt_modifier']}"
