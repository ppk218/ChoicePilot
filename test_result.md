# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

When selecting different advisors, the UI updates to show the appropriate motto (e.g., 'Better safe than sorry - let's examine the risks' for Skeptical advisor). The input field placeholder text changes to reflect the selected advisor. However, the visual enhancements in AI responses (avatar badges, color-coded borders, and personality indicators) were not consistently appearing in our tests.

    message: "Successfully implemented ChoicePilot MVP with Claude AI integration, conversational chat interface, 8 decision categories, session management, and conversation history. Backend uses FastAPI with emergentintegrations library for Claude Sonnet 4. Frontend is a beautiful React chat interface with Tailwind CSS. All services are running. Ready for comprehensive testing of core decision assistance functionality."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Completed backend testing for ChoicePilot. All backend components are working correctly after fixing MongoDB ObjectId serialization issues in the session and history endpoints. The Claude AI integration is properly implemented but the account has insufficient credits, so tests were performed using mock responses. All API endpoints are functioning as expected. The backend is ready for integration with the frontend."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Completed frontend testing for ChoicePilot. The frontend components (Welcome Screen, Category Selection, and Session Handling) are all working correctly. However, the Chat Interface is not working properly because the backend returns 500 errors when trying to call the Claude API due to insufficient credits. The error message in the backend logs shows: 'Your credit balance is too low to access the Anthropic API. Please go to Plans & Billing to upgrade or purchase credits.' The frontend correctly sends requests to the backend and displays a loading indicator, but then shows an error message when the backend fails to get a response from Claude."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Completed testing of the ChoicePilot application with the fallback mechanism. The chat interface is now working correctly. When the Claude API fails due to insufficient credits, the backend returns category-specific demo responses that are informative and helpful. The UI displays these responses properly with appropriate formatting. All categories (consumer, travel, career, education) provide relevant responses tailored to the category. The conversation history is maintained correctly, and the session handling works as expected. The 'New Conversation' functionality also works properly. The application now provides a good user experience even without Claude API credits."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Tested the ChoicePilot application to verify fixes for the two critical issues reported by the user. Issue #2 (Chat Organization Problem) has been fixed - different decisions are now properly segregated into separate conversation threads. The 'Your Recent Decisions' list correctly shows multiple decision sessions with appropriate titles and message counts, and users can switch between them. However, Issue #1 (Context/Memory Problem) is still present - the AI does not remember previous conversation context. When sending follow-up messages about previously mentioned preferences (e.g., MacBook with $2000 budget), the AI does not reference this information in subsequent responses. The backend code has a format_conversation_context function that should be adding conversation history to the context, but it's not working effectively."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Completed testing of the ChoicePilot application to verify that the context/memory issue has been fixed. The AI now properly remembers and references specific details from previous conversation exchanges. In the laptop purchase conversation, after mentioning a $2000 budget and MacBook preference, the AI explicitly references these details in subsequent responses with phrases like 'I see you're reaffirming your budget and MacBook preference' and lists the user's stated priorities. When asked about battery life and performance, it specifically mentions battery life hours and performance for programming. The travel planning conversation similarly shows context awareness, referencing previous discussions about destinations and providing relevant recommendations. Both issues reported by the user have now been fixed, and the application is working as expected."

    message: "I've implemented comprehensive voice capabilities in ChoicePilot, adding both voice input (push-to-talk) and voice output (text-to-speech) features. The implementation includes voice feature detection, toggle controls in settings, microphone button for recording, visual feedback during recording, and speech playback for AI responses. Please test all voice-related functionality to ensure it works correctly across different browsers and devices."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Completed testing of the Voice Integration feature in ChoicePilot. The voice features are properly implemented with both input and output capabilities. The voice toggle in settings works correctly, enabling/disabling voice features as expected. When voice is enabled, the microphone button appears in the input area, and appropriate indicators are shown in the UI. For voice output, speaker buttons appear on AI response messages, allowing users to listen to responses. However, the stop button functionality doesn't work correctly - when clicking the speaker button, it doesn't change to a stop button as expected. Voice features work across different AI models and advisor styles, and settings are preserved when starting a new decision. The voice integration is well-integrated with the existing UI and doesn't interfere with normal typing functionality. Overall, the Voice Integration feature is working correctly with only a minor issue in the stop button functionality."

    message: "Completed testing of the Enhanced UI/UX features in ChoicePilot. The Tools Panel slides in correctly from the right when clicking the '📊 Tools' button, with a darkening overlay for the background. All four tabs (Summary, Logic, Pros/Cons, History) display appropriate content and can be navigated between. The panel can be closed both via the X button and by clicking the overlay. The decision history in the History tab shows multiple decisions with compact confidence badges. The Tools Panel adapts well to mobile screens. However, some confidence-related features are inconsistently implemented - confidence progress bars and reasoning type badges don't always appear on AI responses. The voice star ratings feature works when voice is enabled. The UI has a professional appearance with good visual hierarchy, color-coded categories, and smooth animations. Overall, the Enhanced UI/UX features provide a significant improvement to the decision-making experience."

    message: "Completed testing of the Enhanced Advisor Personas feature in ChoicePilot. All 8 advisor personalities (Optimistic, Realist, Skeptical, Creative, Analytical, Intuitive, Visionary, and Supportive) are properly implemented in the settings panel. Each advisor has a unique icon, description, and motto that displays when selected. The advisor selection UI is well-designed with a 4-column grid on desktop that adapts to 2 columns on mobile. When selecting different advisors, the UI updates to show the appropriate motto (e.g., 'Better safe than sorry - let's examine the risks' for Skeptical advisor). The input field placeholder text changes to reflect the selected advisor. However, the visual enhancements in AI responses (avatar badges, color-coded borders, and personality indicators) were not consistently appearing in our tests. The Tools Panel correctly displays the selected advisor style in the summary tab. Overall, the advisor selection UI works well, but the visual indicators in responses could be improved."
