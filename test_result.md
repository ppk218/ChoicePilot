    message: "Tested the TRULY FIXED DYNAMIC FOLLOW-UP SYSTEM with the completely rewritten SmartFollowupEngine. The system is still only partially working. Out of 4 test scenarios, only 2 passed successfully (50% success rate). The system correctly handles vague vs. detailed answers - when given a vague answer like 'I'm not sure, maybe' it asks for more specifics, and when given a detailed answer about career change with financial concerns, it asks about financial buffer. The system also correctly identifies information gaps - when given financial information about house buying but no timeline/personal factors, it asks about non-financial factors. However, it still fails in two critical areas: 1) Basic Dynamic Follow-up Test - The system returns the same follow-up question regardless of different answers to the same initial question. When testing with 'Should I quit my job?' and providing two different answers ('I hate my job and want to start my own business' vs 'I love my job but got a higher salary offer elsewhere'), the system returned the exact same second question: 'What emotions are driving this decision?'. 2) Conflicted Answer Test - When given a conflicted answer about moving cities (job opportunity vs. family ties), the follow-up question doesn't specifically address this conflict. The code in SmartFollowupEngine in server.py has been rewritten with proper context-aware logic and enhanced prompt engineering, but the implementation is still not effectively generating truly context-aware questions based on previous answers in all scenarios."
