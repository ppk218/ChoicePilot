        comment: "Tested all the backend endpoints required for the UI/UX redesign. Authentication endpoints (/api/auth/register, /api/auth/login, /api/auth/me) are working correctly. Decision flow endpoint (/api/decision/step) is also working properly. The anonymous decision flow endpoint (/api/decision/step/anonymous) has an implementation issue with the LLMRouter.get_response method, and the feedback endpoint (/api/decision/feedback/{decision_id}) is not found. CORS is properly configured for the frontend. The backend is responding on port 8001 as expected."
