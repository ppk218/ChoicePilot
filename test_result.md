        comment: "Conducted comprehensive testing of Round 2 bug fixes. Found several issues: 1) Email validation is working correctly, rejecting invalid emails like 'abc123'. 2) Name validation is NOT working - it accepts numeric and special characters when it should only accept alphabetic characters. 3) Password requirements are NOT fully enforced - only length validation (8+ chars) is working, but it doesn't enforce uppercase, lowercase, number, and symbol requirements. 4) Authenticated decision flow API is working correctly. 5) Anonymous decision flow has an error in the generate_followup_question function which is passing incorrect parameters to LLMRouter.get_llm_response() (passing 'category' parameter which doesn't exist in the method signature). 6) Decision feedback endpoint is working correctly. 7) Decision IDs are generated properly as UUIDs. 8) The backend handles different decision types (career, purchase, relocation, general) correctly."
