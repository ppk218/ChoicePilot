The system successfully analyzes each user answer and determines appropriate follow-up questions with helpful nudges. The recommendations include all required enhanced features: confidence scores (ranging from 75-85), detailed reasoning, specific next steps as actionable bullet points, and comprehensive trace information showing models used (Claude and GPT-4o), frameworks used (Pros/Cons, Priority Alignment, Risk Assessment, etc.), themes, confidence factors, and personas consulted.
