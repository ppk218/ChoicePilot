        comment: "Tested all the backend endpoints required for the UI/UX redesign. Authentication endpoints (/api/auth/register, /api/auth/login, /api/auth/me) are working correctly. Decision flow endpoint (/api/decision/step) is also working properly. The anonymous decision flow endpoint (/api/decision/step/anonymous) has an implementation issue with the LLMRouter.get_response method, and the feedback endpoint (/api/decision/feedback/{decision_id}) is not found. CORS is properly configured for the frontend. The backend is responding on port 8001 as expected. MongoDB connection is working correctly."

        comment: "Verified the fixes for the backend issues. The anonymous decision flow endpoint (/api/decision/step/anonymous) now correctly uses LLMRouter.get_llm_response() instead of llm_router.get_response(). The feedback endpoint (/api/decision/feedback/{decision_id}) has been implemented and is working correctly. Core authentication endpoints (/api/auth/register, /api/auth/login, /api/auth/me) are still working properly. All tests passed successfully."

However, there are issues with the anonymous decision flow endpoint (/api/decision/step/anonymous) which has an implementation error with the LLMRouter.get_response method, and the feedback endpoint (/api/decision/feedback/{decision_id}) which returns a 404 Not Found error. CORS is properly configured for the frontend. The backend is responding on port 8001 as expected. MongoDB connection is working correctly. Overall, the core backend functionality is working, but there are some issues with the anonymous decision flow and feedback endpoints that need to be addressed."
